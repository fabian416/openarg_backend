# OpenArg Backend Specs

Project specifications following **Spec-Driven Design** adapted to hexagonal architecture.

## Purpose

This directory contains the structural documentation of OpenArg **reverse-engineered** from the code: it describes what each component does, how it is built today, and what tech debt exists. It does not modify code; it only documents reality.

Going forward it serves as the basis for **forward SDD**: new features are specified before being coded, reusing the conventions established here.

**Contributor rule**: any PR that changes observable behavior must update the relevant `spec.md` / `plan.md` as part of the change. See the [README § Spec-Driven Design](../README.md#spec-driven-design) for the full contract.

## Module index

The top-level modules are ordered roughly by architectural depth. Modules with ≥3 distinct responsibilities are **decomposed into sub-modules** — in those cases the top-level `spec.md` is a compact index and detailed FRs / tech debt live in the child folders.

| # | Module | Sub-modules | Scope |

| 016 | [`016-serving-port/`](016-serving-port/) | — | `IServingPort` — the medallion-aware discovery surface the pipeline reads instead of physical table names. |
| 017 | [`017-raw-layer/`](017-raw-layer/) | — | The `raw` schema: one immutable table per ingest, `<portal>__<slug>__<hash>__v<N>`, tracked in `raw_table_versions`. |

| 023 | [`023-schema-snapshots/`](023-schema-snapshots/) | — | Preserve a table's shape and value profile before any audited drop, so a format change leaves evidence. |
| 024 | [`024-drift-classification/`](024-drift-classification/) | — | The exoneration cascade: gates that can only prove a shape change was *not* upstream drift. |
| 025 | [`025-self-repair/`](025-self-repair/) | — | Routing a failure to the artefact that is actually wrong: reinduction repairs one table, APR only ever proposes a parser change. |
| 026 | [`026-dataset-refresh/`](026-dataset-refresh/) | — | Reading a source more than once. A dataset is collected once and never again, which makes drift undetectable and answers three months old. |
| 027 | [`027-catalog-integrity/`](027-catalog-integrity/) | — | Making the registry's answers true, and deciding what a resource is when a portal renames it. A registry that lies does not contradict itself. |
| 028 | [`028-ops-mcp/`](028-ops-mcp/) | — | Read-only MCP server over a running environment: queue consumers vs dispatched routes, queue lengths, deployed images. Reads the half of the configuration that lives outside the repo. |

Cross-cutting artifacts:

| Doc | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`constitution.md`](constitution.md) | Non-negotiable principles (hexagonal, DI, async-first, anti-hallucination, ports before adapters). |
| [`FIX_BACKLOG.md`](FIX_BACKLOG.md) | Prioritized list of fixes discovered during spec review (8 items, 5 applied, 3 pending). |
| [`REVIEW_REPORT_2026-04-10.md`](REVIEW_REPORT_2026-04-10.md) | Senior-engineer review pass cross-checking specs against code. |

## Spec format

Each module has **two files**: `spec.md` (the WHAT/WHY) and `plan.md` (the HOW). The separation follows GitHub Spec Kit and respects the hexagonal boundary: `spec.md` lives in the domain language, `plan.md` speaks of infrastructure.

When a module is large enough to warrant sub-modules, its top-level `spec.md` and `plan.md` become compact **indices** that list sub-modules and point to them for detail. The sub-modules each have their own `spec.md` + `plan.md` following the standard template.

### `spec.md` — structure

```markdown
# Spec: <Name>

**Type**: Reverse-engineered | Forward
**Status**: Draft | Reviewed | Canonical
**Last synced with code**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Hexagonal scope**: Domain | Domain+App | Full-stack | Adapter-only

## 1. Context & Purpose
One paragraph. What this feature does for the user/system. Domain level, no technology.

## 2. Ubiquitous Language
Terms with their definitions. Domain only.

## 3. User Stories
Prioritized stories (P1/P2/P3). Each independently testable.
- **US-NNN (Pn)**: As a <role>, I want <action>, so that <benefit>.

## 4. Functional Requirements
Numbered list. Each FR is testable.
- **FR-NNN**: The system MUST ...

## 5. Success Criteria
Observable, tech-agnostic metrics.
- **SC-NNN**: ...

## 6. Assumptions & Out of Scope
What we take for granted and what doesn't belong.

## 7. Open Questions
- **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION CL-NNN]** questions that remain open
- **[RESOLVED CL-NNN]** once an answer is verified against code

## 8. Tech Debt Discovered
- **[DEBT-NNN]** findings from reverse engineering
- **[DEBT-NNN] — FIXED YYYY-MM-DD** once the debt is paid down
```

### `plan.md` — structure

```markdown
# Plan: <Name>

**Related spec**: ./spec.md
**Type**: Reverse-engineered | Forward
**Status**: Draft | Reviewed | Canonical
**Last synced with code**: YYYY-MM-DD

## 1. Hexagonal Mapping
What lives in what layer (Domain / Application / Infrastructure / Presentation).

## 2. As-Built Flow
ASCII diagram or sequence describing the real flow.

## 3. Ports & Contracts
Interfaces consumed/exposed.

## 4. External Dependencies
URLs, auth, rate limits, timeouts, retry policies.

## 5. Persistence
Tables read/written, key columns, referenced migrations.

## 6. Async / Scheduled Work
Celery tasks (name, schedule, queue, retry), LangGraph nodes.

## 7. Observability
Metrics, logs, audit trail.

## 8. Source Files
Map to real files (with paths relative to `src/`).

## 9. Deviations from Constitution
Known violations of `constitution.md` with justification or debt ticket.
```

## Format rules

1. **`spec.md` does not mention technology.** If "HTTP", "SQL", "Celery", "BCRA API" appears — it goes in `plan.md`.
2. **`plan.md` does not invent requirements.** It only describes what exists (reverse) or what was decided (forward).
3. **Every tech debt finding is explicitly marked** with `[DEBT-NNN]` in `spec.md` section 8.
4. **Ambiguities are marked with `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION CL-NNN]`** — they are opened as questions, not resolved by guessing.
5. **Traceability always present**: section 8 of `plan.md` points to real files with paths. If a spec cannot point to the code, it is outdated.
6. **`Last synced with code`** must be bumped whenever a spec is touched alongside a code change.
7. **English only** across all specs (the i18n strings inside code blocks are implementation artifacts and stay as-is).
